##Tamas Wells##

Once upon a time, there was a kid sitting quietly in a bus by the windows. With his earbuds plugged, he listened to an unknown album he just downloaded, he leaned to his right and looked outside. He saw an ocean of green grass, the tallest grass he had ever seen or imagined. All the way long, he just stared outside. He didn't have any particular thought in mind, no admiration for the nature, no turning back screaming how exciting this trip is, no real hard feeling. He was a bit numb. All he had in mind was:

>I'm gonna remember this scene forever.

Then he began to forget about things. He forgot what the licence plate of the bus was like, he forgot how long did it take to go from Paris to Vichy, he forgot how many cases he had to carry, who had help him to move all this into the bus. This movie-like scene began to fade away, first he didn't dream of it anymore, and then he didn't think of it anymore, and then all the notes were gone. No photo was taken. Nothing is left. He can't even go back because he can't recall where it was between Paris and Vichy.

Then he had millions of things to figure out in his life, the idea of going back never occured. Not even the slighest spark of it.

Until today. Until just now. Until he mistakenly found out that there's was an unknown album by an not-so-famous artist in this "favorite" folder on a deserted website. The album folder rang a bell. He didn't know what it meant but curiosity got him. He went on searching for that album on Deezer, and clicked on "Écouter".

And then he freezed. He put down his pen, he just put away all his thoughts.

For some reason, it's like the whole world is shining, and he's surrounded by an ocean of grass, the tallest he could ever imagine, and he ran through the ocean and he ran and ran and ran and he didn't know where is the shore or will it ever end.

It was summer 2008 all again for him.

He remembered laying in the bed staring at the ceiling, wandering what his life would be in six weeks, what Paris was like, what French teenagers was like, what his teachers would be like. Do they smile in a gentle way? Do they have weird jewelrys on them? Do they talk dirty? Will he be able to understand when they talk dirty? What's the classroom like? What's the street like? How's he gonna introduce himself? What if he doesn't understand a single word of his surrounding's conversation? **What will he become?**

He remembered playing with the little girl in the Cruzel family. Football. Oh that way a great match. Pool. Refreshing. Bicycle. Cute. Electric Piano. She played with three fingers. She told him how to say earth quake in French. She asked me to go play with her but I was reluctant. He must had written about her in his diary if he had any.

He remembered his first time cooking. How his mother send him recipes, how it was like the first time going to a supermarket in France. Oh what's the name of this fish that he has never seen before? And you have rice too? And what if he wanted to do something "*à la vapeur*"?

He remembered going to classes. How they walked to home in the afternoon when the bus was out of service. How surprised he was seeing dog poos. How the building in France smelled like. How the paper was different. Even the smell was different. How he had to search through the whole dictionary to find a proper word. How he made up his mind goint to a tabac to buy a pre-paid phone card. How worried his mother was the first time he called, and how calm his father seemed. How the gym was like. How a small eglise is a piece of beauty. How the people in the eglise praised him for having said "Bonne journée". They said he was polite and well educated. How it was like reading "The confessions" was like. How he tried to imagine the **God**. How he tried the understand from religion, belief to everyday habits. How he write down numbers on the back of the bus ticket to remind him of the progress in reading the book. How he turned on the TV and discovered that it was the *Olympic Game* in China. How they decided to gather to see the opening ceremony and how they felt it was amazing. How everyday walking down the street he felt alive and stronger then the day before. How carefree yet intensed it was. How he tried to understand a news on the TV by three or four keywords he could catch. How every morning the sunshine would fill the room thought those tiny little holes in the curtain, and he would walk to the window, open it, and take a deep deep breath.

He just remembered a lot of stuffs. A lot. With the music of *Tamas Wells* playing *Two Years in April*, he was taken back to five year ago. The time when he was amazed by this whole new world he was going to discover, unaware of what his future would be like, putting himself into all kinds of hypothesis, but his nature told him to calm down, to be *indolent*, and to be like a hero in a movie.

He still can't forget about the tall green grass. So he wrote his, unaware of the pile of work to be done, after midnight.

It's a particular feeling. Those bittersweet moments you want to sniff but still want to appreciate. Those which are so far yet so present. Those which you want to hang on to, but no for too long, so that the next time, it will be also fresh and innocent as this time.

Perhaps it's time to stop writing then. Perhaps I should also remove this album from my favorites, so that the next time it will be another surprise.

Oh music. How on earth do you manage to carry so many complicated feelings in a handful of notes.
